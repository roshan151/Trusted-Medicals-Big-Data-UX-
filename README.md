# Trusted-Medicals-Big-Data-UX-
This project was made for Trusted Medicals - a health care company that wanted to shift its database on NoSQL servers. Trusted Medicals organized a competition in UTD to design UX for a website that will provide a platform to book appointments and fill up medical forms . This data will then be stored in AWS Dynamo DB and participants will have to create a demo database to showcase that.I have designed a No-SQL database on Amazon DB and provided samaple entries. The reasoning behind selecting partion key, sort key and global secondary index is mentioned.
